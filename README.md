INTRODUCTION
------------
This module provides a basic interface to allow your users to utilize your
server's NCBI BLAST+.

Specifically it provides blast program-specific forms (blastn, blastp, tblastn,
blastx are supported). In the future, there will be a single form where you
will be able to select either a nucleotide or a protein database to BLAST
against regardless of the type of query and it will decide which BLAST
program to use based on the combination of query/database type (ie: if you
selected a protein database on the nucleotide BLAST form then blastx would
be used).

BLAST submissions result in the creation of Tripal jobs which then need to run
from the command-line. This ensures that long running BLASTs will not cause
page time-outs but does add some management overhead and might result in longer
waits for users depending on how often you have cron set to run Tripal jobs.
You can alternatively use the [Tripal Jobs Daemon](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/tree/7.x-3.x/tripal_daemon)
to automate running of Tripal Jobs reducing user wait time and your own workload.

The BLAST results page is an expandable summary table with each hit being
listed as a row in the table with query/hit/e-value information. The row can
then be expanded to include additional information including the alignment.
Download formats are allow users to download these results in the familiar
tabular, GFF3 or HTML NCBI formats.

Installation
------------
1. Install NCBI BLAST+ on your server (Tested with 2.2.26+). There is a
   package available for Ubuntu to ease installation.
2. Install this module as you would any Drupal module (ie: download, unpack
   in sites/all/modules and enable through http://[your site]/admin/modules)
3. Create "Blast Database" nodes for each dataset you want to make available
   for your users to BLAST against. BLAST databases should first be created
   using the command-line makeblastdb program with the -parse_seqids flag.

 It's recommended that you also install the [Tripal Job Daemon](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/tree/7.x-3.x/tripal_daemon)
 to manage BLAST jobs and ensure they are run soon after being submitted
 by the user. Without this additional module, administrators will have to
 execute the Tripal jobs either manually or through use of cron jobs.

We have an extensive [user guide](https://tripal-blast-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html) and a [developer guide](https://tripal-blast-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_guide.html) available via [readthedocs](https://tripal-blast-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**NOTE: These modules will be combined into a single download available
here in Tripal 4.**

Future Development
-------------------
 - Improvements to XML reader for support of larger result sets
 - The ability to blast against 2+ datasets at the same time
 - Ability to Email user when BLAST is done
 - Automatic cleaning up of BLAST job files after 1 week (make time frame configurable)
